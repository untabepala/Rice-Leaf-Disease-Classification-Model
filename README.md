# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Classification-Model
I created a deep learning model to predict rice leaf diseases classification using image processing. This model can accurately classify Bacterial Blight, Blast, Brown Spot, and Tungro diseases with an impressive accuracy of 99.12%, helping farmers detect and manage these issues early.

Here are brief descriptions and captions for each rice leaf disease I mentioned:

**Bacterial Blight:**
Description: Bacterial blight is a serious disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae. It manifests as water-soaked streaks on leaves, which later turn yellow and then brown, leading to leaf wilting and drying.

**Blast:**
Description: Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. It appears as diamond-shaped lesions with a gray center and brown borders on leaves.

**Brown Spot:**
Description: Brown spot, caused by the fungus Bipolaris oryzae, features brown lesions with a dark brown margin and light brown or grayish center, often leading to leaf blight.

**Tungro:**
Description: Rice tungro disease is caused by the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV). Symptoms include stunted growth, yellow to orange discoloration of leaves, and reduced tillering.
