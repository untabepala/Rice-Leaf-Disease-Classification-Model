# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Classification-Model
I created a deep learning model to predict rice leaf diseases classification using image processing. This model can accurately classify Bacterial Blight, Blast, Brown Spot, and Tungro diseases with an impressive accuracy of 99.12%, helping farmers detect and manage these issues early.
